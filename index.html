		<h2>More about me</h2>
		<p style="background-color: lavender;">I talked a little about me last week, but here is some more information about me. I have a twin sister who also goes here to MNSU, and we kind of have similar names, her name is Rose and mine is Roseline. People always think that wer're one person which gets annoying and can be frustating at times. Thats one of the reasons why I plan on changing my name in about 13 months, hint how my website name is Jay, thats my nickname and everyone calls me that because they get us mixed up. </p>
