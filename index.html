	<h1>About Me!</h1>
	<h2>Hello, my name is Roseline!</h2>
	<p>I am a senior here at MNSU and I am majoring in Interdisciplinary Studies, with concentrations of Graphic Design, Marketing and Mass Media. I am leaning towards the art section then the other concentrations. I've been into graphic design since I was a kid and I really enjoy it! I also have a my own online business as well, and that is why I chose to join this class!</p>
